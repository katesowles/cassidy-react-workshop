import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  // NOTE: useState returns a tuple:
  // let count = useState(0);
  // let variable = count[0];
  // let setter = count[1];
  // but most folks just destructure it as shown below
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  let [error, setError] = useState(null)
  // NOTE: use state's "set" function is very performant, it creates a diff and only calls setVariable when the value to be set is different form the current state value.
  // NOTE: useState is local to the component, so the state can't "escape" from each instance of a component... So if we used more than one <Counter /> in a parent component, they'll each have their own state to be managed separately.
  // NOTE: someone in the workshop asked, how many useStates in a component before you switch to a useReducer â€” Cassidy's response was that her "number" is usually about 4 useStates, but we'll get into that later.
